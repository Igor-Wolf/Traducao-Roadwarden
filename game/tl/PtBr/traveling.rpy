You walk, leading your mount, with an axe in your hand. \n\nIn the middle of the road, after reaching one of the higher hills, you take a glance ahead. Even from here you see the sun reflecting from the ocean, but there’s also a pillar of smoke coming from the distant west. There may be a volcano somewhere behind the horizon, but you can’t tell if it’s a part of the peninsula, or maybe a yet stranger land. \n\nOnce you get to the other side of the mountain, you find the northern entrance to the tunnel, blocked by the bronze gate you saw from the inside. In the sunlight, it’s not as towering. "

    old "{color=#f6d6bd}[horsename]{/color} welcomes the light on the other side of the tunnel. The road now leads downhill, through the meadows, and toward the village placed alongside the stream - even from here, you see the smoke, the tall fortress, and the wide walls. \n\nYou take a look at the crossroad to your left, which is the other end of the detour that leads around the mountain, and partially through it. Exploring the tunnels took a lot of effort, but in the long run, it may save you and other travelers a lot of time. "

You take a sip of water and start climbing. \n\nThe road is winding and narrow, but it would fit a single wagon if it wasn’t for the sporadic rocks and boulders blocking the path. Some of the larger ones are resting just in the middle, and as you look above, you struggle to recognize where they came from. "
