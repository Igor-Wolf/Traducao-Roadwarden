    old "At the top of the hill you reach a stone wall, a quiet place with no smoke coming from behind it. You look inside and see the glimpse of a peaceful ruin. While the main road is beaten and easy for hooves to trod, the destroyed gate and the remains of the front yard have almost been reclaimed by the short grasses. \n\nYou seek any suspicious movement, but the place seems to be free of inhabitants larger than a falcon.[deafcustom1] "

One of the animals, standing only a few feet away from you, is jumping and showcasing its tiny, sharp teeth and a raccoon-like black mask on its little head. The animal, with its thick, brownish-gray fur, seems more stout than any red fox. \n\nThe second loud creature jumps onto a table made of a halved trunk. Unlike the first one, it has a brighter, golden fur. It bends one of its forelegs, observing you with its dark eyes, not furious, nor scared, rather sad and protective. Its growl turns into a miserable whine. \n\nThe beasts are not even waist-high, but their number may be an issue. There’s yet another sound coming from behind you, and even more from the bushes nearby. "

You try to keep it at a distance, aware that another fox is approaching you from the back slowly, but then you get hit by the golden critter, which is clinging to your [custom1] with its claws and reaching for your neck. [custom2] the fox’s jaw is almost at the edge of its teeth, but you’re conscious enough to grab it and throw it away, making it hit the wall with an unpleasant thud. \n\nYou maintain your cold blood and swing your weapon at the fox that wants to bite your leg. It tries to dodge, but not quickly enough - you land a hit, and the whining beast moves away, leaving a trail of blood behind it. The pain scares away the two stronger foxes, and the third one is unwilling to attack you without assistance. You raise your blade, and they wait no longer. The stronger two run for their pups, grab them by their necks, and, keeping their distance, carry them to the hole in the wall, near the bare tree. They get through it with confident jumps. \n\nBefore the lumbering one disappears into the wilderness, it gives the pack’s shelter one last glance. "
