    old "The roars of the sea reach you first, then the cold wind and the light - there are hardly any shrubs nearby, and as you ride downhill, toward the white-and-gold beach, the sunbeams hit you with full force. \n\nThe sea here is not like the one from {color=#f6d6bd}Hovlavan’s{/color} port. The harbor and waters most people see during their busy days are full of life - ships, warehouses, traders, dockers. And of course, there’s Sickle, the barrier island that provides the city with its lagoon, but also serves as a home to dozens of species of birds, monkeys, and rodents. For most people, the sea is never silent. \n\nBut if one travels to Sickle and looks west, or embarks on a boat and sails away, there’s yet another view, a very different one. The never-ending blue, the emptiness, the humming waves, the monsters swimming to the surface just to take a breath, not even interested in the wooden vessels. Many say that if one jumps off a ship with a heavy stone, they will drown before they touch the seabed. \n\nHere, however, the water can’t be separated from the rocks that cut through it, like a swarm of mushrooms in a dark forest. Their shapes and sizes vary, but it’s their number that makes them unusual. If you were to name each one, you’d have to make up at least half of the names. \n\nThere’s no doubt where the name of {color=#f6d6bd}Gale Rocks{/color} comes from. The stones piercing through the surface of the water are shaped like beast fangs, as if they’re asking the ships to dare and test their strength. "

    old "You follow the sharp turn to the right. The road remains broad enough for carts and wagons, and avoids the sands, letting {color=#f6d6bd}[horsename]{/color} trot without disturbances. The grasses to the east and south are short, and hardly any shrubs have managed to oppose the harsh winds. \n\n[beach_fishers_fluff] \n\nYou reach the end of the beaten path, getting to the stone-made pier, just next to a small, dolmen-shaped shed. Only the door seems to be fairly new, and you don’t doubt that both of the structures have been repaired many times in the past, crumbling under the touch of the waves. "

    old "You stay close to your mount, observing the disorder of rocks, dead plants, and animal remains that are coating the sand. The pieces of wood, with their forgotten stories of foreign lands and sunk ships, are gathered in short stacks. You approach the largest pile, and push all the sticks, boughs, and branches aside, sparking displeased shouts of worms, crabs, and other beings that used to live among them. \n\nYou find the piece you were looking for, which is unlike the others. Not too thick, nor too long, and with a few little chunks of wood coming out of only one end, like a bunch of fingers. You nod with approval, reciting in your head a part of the withering dust recipe: {i}fuel with an ocean wood in the shape of a flower{/i}. "
