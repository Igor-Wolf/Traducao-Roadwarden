The gentle waterfall ahead won’t be too difficult to reach, but if it’s not the spot that hides the old harbor, the wasted effort and cold winds will surely exhaust you before you find it. \n\nYou look south. There’s another waterfall there, one much more fierce. \n\n[custom11] "

    old "The long minutes go by, and the roar of the waterfall devours all the other sounds. Here, the “wall” of the island isn’t as flat as it seemed to be from afar, and the tide lets you reach a few high ledges, flat and wide enough for a boat. Even though it’s dark, you recognize some old wooden beams, as well as a few copper rods - remains of an old structure. \n\nThere’s another boat, or rather a small chunk of it, tied to a post just a few steps away from you. \n\nAll of you get out and scrape the hull against the ash-colored rocks.
