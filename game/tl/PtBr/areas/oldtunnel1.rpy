    old "The road fades into an old tunnel. There are no signs of mining, no signposts, no human voices. The ceiling is supported by wooden beams, but the light only reaches so far. \n\nThe chilling wind mercilessly bends the few lonely trees, while the shrubs oppose the weather patiently.[deafcustom1] \n\nThe side path leading west is somewhat maintained, and you find both boot prints and cart tracks. It leads higher into the mountains. "

You grab your tinderbox and sit on the ground for a couple of minutes, preparing the flint and the linen char cloth. Decades ago, before The Southern Invasion, people used fire strikers made of thick steel, but all you have is a cube-like piece of harsh pyrite. It’s not the best, but it’s enough to make a couple of sparks. \n\nThe loud, flickering, yellow light unevenly hits your cheek with heat.

The floor is littered with bones and rotting food, most likely dragged in here by wild beasts, but there are also signs of soot above you, and boot prints left on the dried mud. \n\nYou reach the crossroads and stop in place. There’s no sconce in sight, so you’d have to constantly carry the torch, or lose it for good - and it won’t last for long anyway. The draft is hardly noticeable, so looking for an exit in the dark could be dangerous. "
