    old "[custom1] The light touches the road and shrubs, blocked only by the single willow, wild and untrimmed. You’re by a lake, too large for you to see its other bank, but the local soil isn’t too fertile. There are only a few trees on the horizon, while the struggling bushes and grasses fight with layers of rocks. [custom2] \n\nA gray rabbit is cleaning its fur near the brook, but the sound of hooves makes it hop toward the nearest shrub. Right after it sinks into the leaves, you hear its squeal, cut off quickly. Whatever its hunter was, it leaves behind only the rustling of the thicket and a trail of blood. \n\nYou wait for a long minute with a hand on your axe, but the creature doesn’t return. You relax a bit, then turn toward the stone statue of a young woman. "
