We’ve accepted that they won’t be back.” \n\nAfter a long pause, he puts on his hat again. “Our village is small, but we now have to do almost daily trips.

It’s weirdly warm from the sun. “That’s the {i}only{/i} wolf any of us felled in the last five years, you see? Not that we’re cowards,” he suddenly raises his voice. “Our trade just isn’t like the big game hunters’. I place fish traps, put glue to catch birds, shoot rocks at rats and rabbits. When in a group, we may seek roe deer or aurochs.” \n\nHe takes the hat back and looks at it with nostalgia. “Those in the inn seek trophies, not meat, so they hunt for big beasts, ones that, you know. Fight back. Our ways are different, but I like that bunch. At least they smile, unlike others in the peninsula. Hunters will always find a common tongue. Once you see enough blood and guts, you have to laugh, or go crazy.” "
