    old "[deafcustom1]They’re sitting on branches and in the tall grass, not really trying to hide. Their thick black-and-gold furs cover their entire shells, aside from the charcoal-black faces with roundish, flat noses and wide nostrils. The younger members of the pack are about the size of your mount’s head, but the larger ones would be chest-high if it wasn’t for the fact they walk on all fours. Their long tails are like an additional arm, helping them climb, hang from the branches, or hold food while they eat. \n\nThey aren’t particularly muscular, but when they form their pink lips into the shape of a cup to release their howls, their mouths are so wide they could fit your entire arm inside. As you listen to the shouts, you reach for your head - you feel a weird itch, but somehow you can’t scratch it. "
