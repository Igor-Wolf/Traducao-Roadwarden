    old "The coast is a mixture of green and gray, with sands already covered by the water. The waves hit the land fiercely, but can’t put an end to the screeching of seagulls. \n\nThe signs of human presence are fading away - the grasses overgrow the path, the palisade and building are already collapsing. The lonely tree, still bearing signs of human pruning, is unkempt and wild. You see no smoke or lights. "

You walk by dozens of rocks, many of which are much larger than you, or even two or three people standing on top of each other. \n\nThe land reaching from this point to the distant, steep cliff is desolate. One could bring here a treasure, bury it under any of those silent sentinels, then never find it again. "

    old "The sea here is not like the one from {color=#f6d6bd}Hovlavan’s{/color} port. The harbor and waters most people see during their busy days are full of life - ships, warehouses, traders, dockers. And of course, there’s Sickle, the barrier island that provides the city with its lagoon, but also serves as a home to dozens of species of birds, monkeys, and rodents. For most people, the sea is never silent. \n\nBut if one travels to Sickle and looks west, or embarks on a boat and sails away, there’s yet another view, a very different one. The never-ending blue, the emptiness, the humming waves, the monsters swimming to the surface just to take a breath, not even interested in the wooden vessels. Many say that if one jumps off a ship with a heavy stone, they will drown before they touch the seabed. \n\nHere, however, the water can’t be separated from the rocks that cut through it, like a swarm of mushrooms in a dark forest. Their shapes and sizes vary, but it’s their number that makes them unusual. If you were to name each one, you’d have to make up at least half of the names. "

    old "You stay close to your mount, observing the disorder of rocks, dead plants, and animal remains that are coating the grasses. The pieces of wood, with their forgotten stories of foreign lands and sunk ships, are gathered in short stacks. You approach the largest pile, and push all the sticks, boughs, and branches aside, sparking displeased shouts of worms, crabs, and other beings that used to live among them. \n\nYou find the piece you were looking for, which is unlike the others. Not too thick, nor too long, and with a few little chunks of wood coming out of only one end, like a bunch of fingers. You nod with approval, reciting in your head a part of the withering dust recipe: {i}fuel with an ocean wood in the shape of a flower{/i}. "
