    old "{color=#f6d6bd}[horsename]’s{/color} hooves thump loudly on the beaten track. The green bushes, shrubs, and trees prove that the soil here is fertile, yet the plants don’t overgrow the road. These crossroads must be busy at times, maybe even patrolled. \n\nIn the distant west, you see the mountain peaks dividing the lowlands from the ocean. [custom1][custom2][custom3][westerncrossroads_knownpaths] \n\nYou’re surrounded by four signposts, all of which seem to be made from the same type of wood, now covered in moss and fungi, yet the pictures and letters that cover the nailed boards are nothing alike.
