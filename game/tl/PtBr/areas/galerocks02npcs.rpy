    old "[custom1] \n\nHis outfit is heavy, appropriately so for someone who spends long hours under the hits of the cold onshore winds. The massive leather boots, thick tunic and pants, and the heavy cloak, now held under his arm, make you wonder if he’d even be able to swim. \n\nLike most seafolk, he has long limbs, almost no facial hair, and ears so flat they are hardly noticeable. His neck draws your eyes - it’s covered with marks left by the burning suckers of a sea monster, as wide as your finger is long. Below these scars he’s wearing a pendant made of a fist-sized black “beak”. \n\nHe speaks first, with the strong and confident voice of a young man, no older than twenty-five. “We don’t really sell any catch on our own, maybe ask our smokers, or the cook.” "
