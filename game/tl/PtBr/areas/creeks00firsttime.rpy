    old "You follow the trail of shouts and laughter. Seven people, about twenty years old each, are gathered at the wooden bridge, leaning against the railing, bathing in the stream, lying on the grass. Pieces of clothing - made of fur and leather - are spread around, next to cudgels and throwing clubs. \n\nOnce the sound of hooves manages to break through the chattering, the curious, young eyes, untouched by wartime, turn toward you, and an excited whisper spreads. The shells are proudly displayed, and the confident smiles are both inviting and challenging. \n\n“How’s water,” {color=#f6d6bd}the hunter{/color} greets his tribesfolk while stepping on the logs. “Gentle and warm,” says a man resting on his friend’s shoulder. “[custom1]” \n\nThere are paths leading in many directions, but the main road will take you uphill.
