    old "“I could tell ye stories for days, but who cares?” He chuckles. “I’m just doing my thing, moving from wall to wall, sleeping where they let me, buying what I need, selling what I can, saving dragons for later on. I used to be a sailor, people called me {color=#f6d6bd}Pyrrhos{/color} because of the, ye know, forehead. But I’m not one to push a plough or patch ship sails all day long. I don’t care if a corpser eats my bones one day, as long as I can stay free for a couple of years more.” \n\n“And I’m damn good at staying safe, or rather I was before I landed in this shithole.” He touches his scarred face and smirks unpleasantly. “I haven’t gotten one of these in years, but it didn’t take two weeks on the road here and I almost lost my legs. Spent all my coin in {color=#f6d6bd}Howler’s Dell{/color} for elders’ magic.” He brushes some invisible dust off his pants. “Not the first time I have an empty pouch, not gonna lie, but there’s no coin waiting here. Once I push all the iron to the locals, I’m moving South. Though I won’t ride alone, I’m not making that mistake again.” "

He landed just next to {color=#f6d6bd}Gale Rocks{/color}, a large fishing village near the northern shore. People there were irritable and unwilling to idly chat with him, but “opened their mouths” after he helped them at the smokehouse. On sunny days, the locals hunt on the shore, and when it gets dark, they hide behind the walls, gutting the fish. \n\n“And when the weather goes to shit, they boil water for salt and put fish in it, then hop to the barrels, though I don’t know how, they don’t have many trees around. Then they sell the meat to the villages and... And, ye know. Places.” He clears his throat. “For crops.” "

So I left once at dawn, me and my bird, and wasn’t that a mistake!” \n\nHe was attacked by a short bear-like creature. He tried to run away, but following his bird was a bad idea. He fell over in the thicket, so the monster had time to get to him. “I hit it with a bolt, wasn’t enough. I kicked it, so it bites my legs, tears my flesh away. I almost dozed off from pain, ba’can ye believe it? That lazy bird came back and charged at it with its beak!” His dagger was enough to get through the surprised animal’s belly. It ran away. "

Once ye get there, she’ll make sure to see ye. Ye’ll know it’s her. She’s short, and her blond hair is straight and long. She wears dresses and rouges her cheeks like a merchant.” He points at the scar on his own face, which doesn’t help your imagination. “She’s not scary, not scary at all, at least as long as ye don’t ask about her wealth.
