    old "Her long, full-sleeved linen dress must have been dyed once in blue and once in red to achieve its dark, fancy purple, which would draw looks even in {color=#f6d6bd}Hovlavan{/color}. From her left shoulder hangs a green, woolen cape, as thin as a shawl. The brown belt on her waist has a large steel buckle that portrays a running deer with unrealistically large antlers, growing in all directions like tree branches. \n\nUnlike her tribesfolk, she’s pale, with powdered and rouged cheeks, and her lips match her outfit, though they’re a bit closer to wine-red. The thick, gray strands in her long, blond hair look more like a fashion choice than a result of aging. Her eyes are the color of her cape, keen and vigorous. \n\nShe’s shorter than most people around, though would still be the tallest woman in most of the Northern settlements. While she’s around forty, her slim hands add fragility to her appearance, even though her posture is upright, her legs confidently crossed, and her delicate voice assertive. She makes plenty of gestures, but her shoulders hardly ever move. "
