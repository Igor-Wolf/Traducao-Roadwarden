    old "Its movements are deliberate and confident. It makes a tiger-like leap, then stands still like a statue, while the brown, white, and yellow feathers covering the front half of its shell are still dancing with the wind. The wings hinder your sight, so you spot only glimpses of the cat-like claws and the clay-like fur. Its large chest rises and falls slowly. \n\nThe noble griffon’s yellow eyes speak only of violence. Its curved beak is longer than your forearm, and the talons on its front paws are like sickles. You don’t doubt that its cruel promises may not only be fulfilled, but are a certainty.
