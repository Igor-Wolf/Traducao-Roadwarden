After seeing the headwoman’s nod, the crossbowwoman leaves her weapon leaning against the chair and runs outside. \n\n“It will take a while before my granddaughter gathers everyone here, a few of the elders like to pretend she’s not there. I’ll pick up some berries with honey for us,” she heads upstairs, followed by the unusual creaking of the planks. \n\nThe perfumed guard approaches you with an awkward smile. “I won’t ask you to leave your blade in another room, but it would be {i}impolite{/i} to face the council, well,” he points at your axe[custom1]. “Like a thug.” "

For now, they’re mostly ignoring your presence, chatting about the increasing frequency of gatherings such as this one. \n\n“We’re not getting any younger, darling,” says an elder introduced to you as the previous head fisher, and {color=#f6d6bd}Severina{/color} responds to him with a smile warmer than any you’ve seen from her. “That’s alright, no one here gets old quicker than I do behind this desk,” she responds, and the man chuckles. \n\nYou’ve met some of them already, but the perfumed man is eager to announce every newcomer to you, dropping many names and the roles they are responsible for. Most of the elders are described to you by their past trades - artisans, overseers, fighters, and one storyteller, drawing a lot of attention with her hoarse, yet sonorous jokes. Even the faces you recognize look {i}different{/i} - wearing elegant tunics, robes, and dresses, with jewelry that for once doesn’t get in the way of their tiresome labor. \n\nAside from them, there are a few younger people. The head salter, head cooper, head cook... Even though their backs are stronger, they seem more timid, not willing to interrupt the elders in their decades old conversations. "

Let’s allow the outsider to speak in peace, and once this is done,” she meets your eyes, “we’ll open the discussion, and move to the vote, so the officials of {color=#f6d6bd}Hovlavan{/color} may know our answer before autumn.” \n\nThe puzzled looks and murmurs make you think not everyone here was aware of the scope of the topic at hand, but they don’t get much time to express their discontent. “So speak, outsider, will you?” Starts the old fisher, and the hall quiets down.
