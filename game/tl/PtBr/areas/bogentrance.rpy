    old "The trees and bushes are sparse here, growing from the barren grassland. Some of them bear late-summer fruits. \n\nA group of wayfarers is spread around the broken signpost and the abandoned cart. They’re skinny, but healthy, and are standing upright. They’re wearing humble, dim gambesons on top of their hemp tunics and pants, all of them worn, in some cases undyed, while others are dark green or brown. Four of these individuals wear cloaks[custom1], and are armed with spears, bows, and stone maces. On their necks, wrists, and belts you spot small talismans - fangs, bones, wooden beads, leather straps. \n\nThere’s also the fifth figure, standing a bit in the back, with lowered shoulders. Unlike the others, they’re hooded, and in such a manner that you doubt they can see anything other than their boots. Their clothes are shabby, torn, but your eyes mostly run to their “club” - a bough as long as its owner is tall and as thick as a leg, resting with one end on the ground. You get closer, and the person raises the weapon with just one arm, but another traveler gestures for them to stop - and they do so right away, freezing in place. "

He doesn’t reach for his weapon, and pushes one of his companions closer to the cart. She kneels by an empty box and looks inside it. \n\nThe man observes you with little curiosity[custom2]. "
