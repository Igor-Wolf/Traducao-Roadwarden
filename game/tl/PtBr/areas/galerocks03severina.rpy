    old "The bright walls stand out from the other structures in the village, and as far as you can tell, the current layer of whitewash is still fresh. There must be at least three floors inside, enough space to contain more than a hundred people, though without much between them. There are arrowslits in the walls, and the roof is surrounded by a fence-like barrier, a perfect spot for boulder throwers and archers. \n\nThe large entrance door is ajar, with a wrinkled man sitting on a pillow placed on the stairs. He’s not wearing a gambeson, but the fine, steel sickle sword at his side makes it clear he’s not just a regular guard. He stops what he was doing, carving a figurine from a log, and stands up to greet you. “Cheers, roadwarden. {color=#f6d6bd}Severina{/color} was told about your arrival. Follow me.” He may be old, but he is tall, with the long and thin arms of a seafolk, a neatly groomed beard, and his gray hair in a ponytail. As you follow him, you’re hit by the strong scent of cloves. "

    old "The door is thick and can be barricaded with two wooden bars. The hall is filled with benches, some of which are placed on top of the others, giving a bit more space for now. There is one path to the next floor, suspiciously covered with planks. \n\nThe chamber is free of the roaring of the river, the shouts of workers, the chaos of animals, or the smell of cooked food. The room is well-lit both by sunlight and candles, and quite drafty, though you still smell perfumes and aging wood. You doubt anyone lives here, or even uses this room for dining. \n\n“The roadwarden is here,” says the guard and approaches the desk, standing between you and the old woman sitting behind it. "

She’s wearing a thick, warm dress in the color of a cherry, and an even darker, modest hat that’s covering her hair. She could be older than seventy, yet her face and hands have been spared from scars harsher than some pockmarks carved by illnesses. If you were to encounter her in {color=#f6d6bd}Hovlavan{/color}, you would expect her to be an official, or maybe a rich scribe. \n\nSome of her belongings, however, wouldn’t be found at the city’s desks. The wax of her tablet isn’t dyed; instead of keeping water in a cup, she has a large, colorful seashell; and the winged hourglass placed on a stone stand is made of dried seaweed. "
