    old "A couple of stone slabs[stonebridge_likedolmen] were turned into a hut-like shape, one of the ancient chapels raised by the priests of The United Church in the days of few soldiers and even fewer shelters. The dolmens proved to be especially durable, though the conditions they offered were harsh. \n\nThe entrance is barely wide enough to let you walk inside. It was meant to keep larger beasts away, including your palfrey. You can’t spend the night here. \n\nYou dismount and look around. "
