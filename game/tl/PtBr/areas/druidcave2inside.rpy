    old "“So be it. We are humble people en we do ne have much to offer, but at least the’s a scrap of floor for you to lie down on, en a stream to wash yourself. Follow me.” \n\nThe door, made of steel and surrounded by bricks, could protect a treasury, or an armory. The same amount of iron could be used for dozens of tools, or over a hundred high-quality spears. You wonder what would happen if there were no more druids around. Would scavengers detach it and melt it down? Would it stay here for centuries, as a relic of the past? \n\nThere’s a single plate in the middle, used to lock or unlock a latch, and an additional padlock, which requires its own, awkwardly large key. There may be a similar device on the other side. \n\nThe gate squeals, and moving it makes the man pant. "

The air is humid, but free of mold and putridity, despite all the wooden furniture around. \n\nThe man points at a bunch of brown and gray furs laying on the floor, mostly taken from boars and deer, though there’s also an especially large one that belonged to a red-and-black bear. “Feel free to pile them up, they should make for a soft bed. Just be sure to spread them around when you wake up, I need them to cover as much of the ground as they can.” \n\nHe also nods toward a wooden table, where you see an array of expensive instruments made of glass, gold, and copper. Bottles, scales, knives, alembics, mortars, a crucible... “En if you do ne know much about alchemy, stay away. ‘Tis expensive, a keepsake. If I find a single scratch on it, you will ne be welcome here anymore.” "

Her soul is shattered, her shell is weak, she no longer speaks. She was the owner of this table.” \n\nYou ask if she won’t be bothered by your presence and you see his sad smile. “She will forget about you soon after she looks away. But she’s dangerous, in a way. If you keep your distance, she will ne approach you, but when she’s stressed, her powers take control over her. Protecting a mad magic user... It’s difficult, traveler.” "
