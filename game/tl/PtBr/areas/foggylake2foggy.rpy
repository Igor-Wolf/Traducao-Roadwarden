They were gathering logs for {color=#f6d6bd}Creeks{/color} and {color=#f6d6bd}Gale Rocks{/color}, but animals didn’t like it, not one bit. Once the summer started, it got too dangerous.

Shameful!” Her shaking chest is like a running beast. “Oh love, they won’t be happy to see you. They live in a cave, far from here, on the mountainside in the far east. They try to stay away from hwat happens in the lowlands, but they don’t even want to trade with us any more, not since...” She waves her hand. “Since almost a decade, I’d say.” \n\nWhen you ask her why their presence is such a secret, she scratches her knee. “It’s their will, and we seek no conflict with their weird shamans. They know of the monks from the monastery, and they’re afraid of hwat they’ll face once the Unites arrive. You know hwat the {i}Church{/i} does to {i}pagans{/i}.” Both of these words are dripping with disgust. “If you have to bother them, ride south, to the old bridge, then turn east, until you reach a game trail. Just stay on the northern side of the brook... And be sure you can get through the thicket, somehow.” "
