    old "{color=#f6d6bd}Thais{/color} sighs, stands up, and approaches the bank, staring in the distance. Her arms are crossed, and for once she doesn’t pay attention to her loose strands of hair. \n\n“I must admit, your words make me hesitant.” Thanks to your recent conversations, the remains of the local accent have now completely left her voice. “We had a good run so far, you and I. Let’s keep it that way. Leave us,” she says to no one in particular, and you hear footsteps leaving the boar pen. Whoever was there, they must have heard everything you’ve been talking about so far. \n\nShe meets your eyes. “Whatever happens, you’ll have my support. Want to stay with us? You’ll live in peace and comfort, as {i}our{/i} warden. Of course, I won’t bother you with too many tasks, just enough to put down any questions. And if you were to find someone to your liking among us... We’ll figure something out.” There’s cruelty in her smile, but also complete confidence. \n\n“If you’d rather stay with the guild, we’ll make sure they’ll {i}have to{/i} keep you around as my {i}trusted envoy{/i}. Once the deal is complete, you’ll get a nice chunk of our taxes. In a few years, you’ll secure yourself a small fortune. But I’d also like to cut a new path to the guild for myself. Together, we could go far.” \n\nShe raises her chin. "

Lengthy conversations without witnesses are in bad taste for a mayor.” \n\nShe leads you back to your usual table, stopping for a minute to chat with a farmer briefly, but also to pick up one of her younger sons, laughing at his big yawn. \n\nBefore she joins you, you look at the nearby faces and listen to the innkeep, who shares a laugh with his neighbors. This could be your home. "

Take the outsider upstairs.” \n\nYou hear footsteps. Three armed men jump over the fence and dash toward you. You spring up, but seeing the crossbow aimed at your chest, you don’t reach for your blade. Soon, someone grabs your hands and pulls them behind your back. "
