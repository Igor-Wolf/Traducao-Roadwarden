Me,” she glances at a few of her men, whose eyes are focused on the nearby grasses and nettles, “and a few others, who were hiding with me in a cave, with raw meat and bark in our stomachs, rags on our backs, and sharpened flints in our hands.” \n\nA rook tries to rest on a wooden post next to her, but as it struggles to stay upright, it rescues itself with a wing flap, then lands on {color=#f6d6bd}Glaucia’s{/color} shoulder, though only for a few heartbeats. Once she carries on, her words flow slowly, dim and flat. \n\n“We pushed the ashes aside, dug in the soft ground, even jumped into the stream, but there were no shells awaiting us. {i}Ghouls{/i}, we thought, {i}runners, or goblins{/i}. We traveled far those days, to warn our last few friends. {i}Awoken will strike{/i}, we told them, {i}make clubs, dig moats{/i}. And we waited, in this very hamlet, seeking them and preparing ourselves.” \n\n“A year went by, then another. We saw the first enslaved shells in {color=#f6d6bd}White Marshes{/color}. The deeds of {color=#f6d6bd}Orentius{/color}, the priest. We thought little of it, not the first sin of our lifetimes, until we realized. It wasn’t merely {i}their{/i} dead who they’d awoken,” her voice cracks, but she manages to keep her composure. “They had taken my husband, his parents, and many others. {i}Wagons{/i} of dead flesh.” \n\nYou spend a good minute in silence. “We’re but a band of workers. We can’t storm walls, or send an army of beasts to punish evil acts. But our work bears fruits, and we’ll find a way to get rid of the necromancers. Or to make their lives so dire they’ll leave their homes on their own.” "

I don’t know what you told them,” the blade cuts through your skin, and the warm, dense blood leaks down the front of your gambeson, “but you’re going to fix it.” \n\nYou’re on the ground, held by her massive boot. “That’s why you’re here, ain’t you?
