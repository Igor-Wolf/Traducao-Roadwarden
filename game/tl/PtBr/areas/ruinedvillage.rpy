    old "The lair is as crude as a rat’s nest, yet escapes your words and senses. The sleeping spots are made of straw, scraps of clothes, feathers, and moss, but are so old and clumped together that you doubt they are any softer than the rotting planks beneath them. The corners are filled with feces, and you don’t think it would make any difference for the creatures to relieve themselves in the middle of the room. You see broken furniture and all sorts of rubbish with no specific shape, nor a purpose you can identify, and a stack of bones and sharpened sticks, taller than you are. \n\nIt’s nothing like the humble shelters that the families of apes build among the tree crowns. It’s tamed chaos, an attempt at maintaining order in a place that ceased to be a human structure, yet is still not a part of the wilderness. \n\nJust a few days ago dozens of beasts were living here, but you can’t imagine how anything could survive in such conditions. The walls are covered with black and green molds. The floor is very much alive, with countless worms, insects, small lizards, and rodents running among the dirt and the fresh shells of furry goblins. The blood, guts, and flesh are covering way more spots than you’d hope for. Something is happening in your stomach. "

By accident, you make one of the piles of furniture collapse, covering the floor with yet another layer of chaos. With every minute you get more upset about the state of your boots and gloves, knowing that some tiresome cleaning is ahead of you. \n\nYour disappointment grows. There are many stories of goblins storing unusual treasures in their lairs, but you find not even a single dragon. Could the hunters have been so sharp-eyed in their search that they’ve left nothing behind? Or were the goblins simply never interested in gathering things for which they found no purpose?[custom2] \n\nYou move a larger plank, an ex-shelf leaning against one of the moldy walls, and you reveal something curious.

You bait the stick and push it inside the basket, locking it between the sides, then cover the entrance with the lid - tying it together takes you a few good moments, but will be easier later on. You attach the entire trap to a bush and push it into the stream, far enough that it sinks entirely. \n\nWho knows how long it will take before something large enough swims inside.
