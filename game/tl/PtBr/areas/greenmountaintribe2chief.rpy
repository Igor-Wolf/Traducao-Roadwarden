    old "The simple huts are short enough for you to see their hide-covered roofs from above, and as you look at the ceiling, there’s no water dripping on them. They don’t offer much privacy, either - even if the entrances were covered with a curtain, the gaps between the bones let you peek inside. It’s as if they one day collapsed here from the surface, losing their purpose, but remaining as a relic of the old way of living. \n\nWhile the huts are only filled with furs and a few pieces of clothing, the chamber is far from empty. A few women, some of them very young, some in their thirties or forties, are sitting around the campfire, feeding infants or playing with toddlers. There’s a man stretching a piece of leather on a tanning rack, and you hear splashes of water coming from a corner. \n\nWhen your eyes land on two people sitting in a circle of wooden stumps, their gaze makes your destination clear.

    old "They are sitting a few steps away from one another, and as you’re invited to sit down, the three of you form a triangle. The air is heavy, but you smell no sweat or dirt, and aside from the crying child and echoes of distant play and conversations, the dancing lights and crackling wood are no less cozy than an inn in the evening. \n\n{color=#f6d6bd}The man in his fifties{/color} is leaning forward, resting his elbows on his thighs, more like a tired guard than a distinguished ruler. He’s dressed just as heavily as the people you saw on the surface, but the fabric of his clothes is so dark-blue that it’s almost black. He’s barefoot, and you wonder if that’s enough to not make him sweat under the layers of wool. His helmet, shield, and sword are resting on the ground. His long gray hair freely surrounds his face, which is covered with wrinkles and scars. Some beast was lucky enough to leave a mark deeper than that - the man’s nose is missing, leaving a disfigured hole. \n\n{color=#f6d6bd}The woman could be twenty-five{/color}, and has absent eyes that are roving over your outfit, equipment, face, and hands. She’s dressed much more humbly than the man - her tunic and pants are undyed and short enough to reveal her calves and forearms. She has unevenly cut short black hair, and a yellow kerchief that’s hanging from her neck, lazily thrown over her back. Her legs are stretched out in front of her, resting on the heels of her sandals and swaying left and right, spread just above an unfolded sack, covered with gemstones, pebbles, and animal bones. She keeps her hands on the nearest trunk, desperate for something to support her back. \n\nBoth of them are unusually pale, but the woman looks almost sick. "

Finally, they allowed the corsairs to start their usual efforts, putting to use the growing height of their ships. At first, they harrassed the fishers, then landed on the island itself. The Tribe was ready to fight for what was theirs, but the cruelty they faced outmatched them. The kidnappings made the locals afraid to leave their walls, and then the raids enslaved whole hamlets, or burned many crucial structures. \n\nUsing traps and their knowledge of the terrain, The Tribe managed to kill more than they lost, but the corsair ships kept coming, always led by new, yet even more experienced captains. After a few bloody battles, the forest fires started, and the locals understood they had little time before the wrath of the herds would trample them to death. \n\n“We are t’ eight’ generation of T’ Tribe living here, so close to t’ coast, yet so far from it,” she ends her tale. “Taming t’ new grounds was harsh, and once t’ first children born in ‘tese tunnels started breat’ing, only a fift’ of T’ Tribe was still here to welcome ‘em.” "
