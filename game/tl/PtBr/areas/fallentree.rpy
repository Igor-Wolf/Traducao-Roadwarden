    old "A roundpine tree blocks the road. For a wayfarer, walking over the thin branches at the top is not much of an issue. Even {color=#f6d6bd}[horsename]{/color}, led on a rope, could walk around the stump, but a large wagon couldn’t move onward in one piece, at least not without detaching the mules, unpacking all the wares, and moving everything by hand. \n\nCutting a tree into pieces would take hours, even with proper tools, and you can’t hope to move it with just the muscles that you and your mount have to offer.

Most of the marks were left by flat, cheap boots, not suitable for long walks, but someone was wearing hard, wide heels, distorting the ground. \n\nBoth trails avoid the eastern wilderness. They stick to the main road, and lead you north. They could have belonged to two dozen people, maybe more. You follow them for a bit, but lose them once there’s no more mud and tree needles to find.
