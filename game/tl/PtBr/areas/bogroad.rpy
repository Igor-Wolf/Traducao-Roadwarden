    old "You’re not used to the scents of the bogs, but you weren’t expecting them to be so gentle. The humid air makes you think of smoked meat, and even though you ride by a few rotting carcasses and animal droppings, just as often you cross tiny meadows of pink, yellow, and red flowers. \n\nThe noises tell stories of neverending wars between the swarms of insects, frogs in their hideouts, snakes lurking among the purple grasses, birds patrolling both the water and the sky, and the saurians preparing to strike from beneath the surface. You can’t separate the sounds of the living from those of the dying, if they’re even different at all. \n\nYou reach a boulder in the middle of the road, on the edge of a large pond. The road splits from here in two directions, but the only smoke you see is to the southeast. "

Some of the plants were felled with tools, so the route itself isn’t so dark, while the few sunbeams getting through the weaker branches on your left are surrounded by darkness and swarms of insects. \n\n“Help me! Help!” The sudden cry, as well as screams of pain, reaches you from between the trees. A woman, or a child. "
