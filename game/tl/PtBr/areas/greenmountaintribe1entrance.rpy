    old "The winds, cold sweat, and altitude make you want to simultaneously take off your cloak and put on some heavier clothes. At least {color=#f6d6bd}[horsename]{/color} doesn’t seem to care. \n\nYou take deeper breaths. The path ahead seems gentler - there are no more trees, and you’re surrounded by grasses, pebbles, sporadic bushes. You look down at the herds gathering around the stream, the rustling leaves, and the birds, large and small, flying above the forests of the peninsula. From here, everything seems calm. "

You can’t see the details of her hair, but she’s not attacking you just yet, resting the blunt edge of her spear on the ground.

    old "You ride through the corridor of rock faces, led by the jumping saurian. {color=#f6d6bd}The woman{/color} in a helmet blows a large horn, longer and thinner than a ram’s, with enough power to cause an avalanche, and once you reach the massive, wooden gate blocking the path, it’s already open. The few people you’ve seen so far are well-equipped, wearing heavy jackets, shields, and steel weapons, though some of them seem a bit old. \n\nYour surroundings get more spacious, with small garden patches and stone sheds spread on both sides of the path. Riding by the onlookers, you enter a trot, then a walk. The locals pay as much attention to you as to your mount, commenting on your appearance in the Old Speech. \n\nUnlike the guards, the workers are carrying rather simple tools, many of them made of bones or rocks. Their woolen, undyed outfits are appropriate for hard labor, worn and patched up, but also heavy, protecting their owners from the cold mountain winds. The one thing that differentiates them from one another is their headgear - every person you see is wearing something on their head, mostly ear-covering kerchiefs, vividly dyed, with embroidered patterns of leaves, flowers, and gems. \n\nThey are seafolk, no doubt about it - they have long limbs, hardly any beards, and the few children you see have uncovered hair, wavy and dense. Yet their paleness is unusual, as if they spend little time outside. \n\n{color=#f6d6bd}Your guide{/color} is nowhere in sight, but so far no one has tried to stop you. "

The crisp air carries the scent of late-summer meadows. Aside from the discussions of farmers and guards, you hear the roaming wind and the gloating ibexes, but the terraces and crops around you are quiet, making you realize it’s the first village you’ve seen in quite a while where there’s no constant noise of humming water, or of heavy labor. \n\n[custom1] \n\nYou realize she’s more than forty, and even if she has a small stature, no one seems eager to replace her as a negotiator, or to question her authority. The accent of those who chat in the distance is so dense you can’t catch a single word. "
