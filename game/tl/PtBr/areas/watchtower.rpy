    old "[deafcustom1]Its upper level lacks a wooden platform from which the guards could fire their crossbows or drop stones on the opponents below, so this place was not meant to be used in combat, but rather as a shelter from claws and fangs. \n\nSuch structures can be found in especially untamed parts of The Dragonwoods, used occasionally by travelers or patrolling squads. Since the end of the war, The Cities can’t find enough people and dragon bones to keep them in good shape. \n\nYou see no footsteps, no lights, no fresh trash or a latrine. The birds are preening their feathers on the top of the tower, while the branches of nearby trees are swaying in the fierce, cold wind. "
