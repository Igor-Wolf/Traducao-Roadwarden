    old "“Ah, shit fire,” her shoulders slope as she starts to wander around the yard. “What happened to him?” \n\nYou share as little as you need, and she doesn’t inquire further. “Is this ne weird? How souls like his get swallowed by the forest, whilst {color=#f6d6bd}Thais{/color} sits on her throne of dragon bones? She gets weaker en weaker from that illness of hers, but still has enough of a breath to lie en scheme. Just stupid.” "

    old "Her hands squeeze her bow, her eyes are keen. After her gentle nod, you tell her what you’ve learned. Tears well up in her eyes even before you finish, but she stares at you intensely, trying to catch a hint of a lie, something to grab on before she puts her trust in your tale. \n\nIn the end, she scratches the sand with her foot, lowering her head. Then, she covers her eyes. “Shame on them. Shame on my... {color=#f6d6bd}Thais{/color}, en on me, for I asked nae questions.” \n\nBefore you respond, she enters her hut for a minute, then returns with fresh water dripping from her face. While her eyes are red, she holds her bow with determination. “‘Tis better to know the truth. I planned to return home one year, but now I do ne know. If I do... {i}I will be heard.{/i}” "
