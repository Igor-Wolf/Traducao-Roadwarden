    old "The path is beaten, yet your mount has to step over branches, large rocks, and even animal bones. While the trees aren’t pruned, they grow sparse enough for you to have a good view of your surroundings. \n\nA pile of rotting logs, the remains of food, and even a broken wagon rest at the feet of the crag. You look up - the palisade has a massive gap in it, which now serves as a vantage point for {color=#f6d6bd}a person you can’t see clearly{/color}. They’re holding an arrow on their strung bow and while they aren’t aiming at you, they’d have enough time to shoot before you got off the saddle. \n\n“You’ve a horse,” the masculine voice announces loudly, then stares at you. “Thought a mad deer was running, I did! Almost shot it in the nose.” Another pause. “Who?” "

[custom1] \n\nThe hamlet could be a generation old, and while the freshly beaten paths, spread trash, and newly fallen trees and gathered rocks make it clear that the dwellers are still altering their surroundings, the woods around you are filled with wildlife, crowding in the tree crowns, grasses, and trunks. A boar flees up the path, keeping its eyes on you as it runs. A dragonling is drinking from the pond you just rode by. \n\nThere are a few people gathered at the gate, and more of them approach you from behind. You count eight of them in total, with only one female face among them. All are younger than forty, with weapons at their sides or in their hands - simple flails, two-handed axes on long hafts, maces, spears, throwing clubs. Equipment so heavy and unwieldy that you can’t be sure if it’s meant to threaten you, or to get through the skin of nearby monsters, if necessary. \n\nSome of those who came through the open gate have bare chests, displaying their scars and bandages, but the others are wearing heavy jackets, and look nothing like pure farmers seeking shelter for a night. \n\nThey observe your mount in silence, together with the curious rooks sitting on the top of the wall.

    old "[custom1] \n\nHer emerald eyes are running over your mount and equipment, reaching your face last, and with little curiosity. She’s broad-shouldered, with a muscular figure and round face. Her long, shining mail rests on a green aketon, making noise with every movement of her arms. Her right hand is tapping the hilt of the sickle sword - a broad blade meant for chopping not just flesh, but also twigs - sheathed at her side. The short, dark hair of a fighter is carefully cut, and her skin is healthily tanned. \n\nIt takes another few breaths for you to notice the other side of her appearance. While she’s wider than anyone in sight, she’s more than a head shorter than you. You spot the gray strands of her hair, and wrinkles cut by scars on her cheeks and lips. Her hand is missing a thumb, explaining why the blade is on her right side, and an old bruise surrounding her left eye hinders her from fully opening it, so it’s difficult for you to match her gaze.

    old "The neglected path leads to a pond, through the rocks sticking out of the ground, fallen branches, and the rotten deck covering a wide puddle. There are some signs of repairs made on the bridge for fishers, but there are also some broken logs and a boat with a large hole in its hull. \n\n{color=#f6d6bd}Glaucia{/color} and two of her guards walk with you in silence, surrounded by the screeching beasts around and above you. She takes leisurely strides, and as you step onto the bridge, looking across the pond, you can see that the woods surround it from all sides, like the walls of a dungeon chamber, with green and gray saurians basking both on the banks and in the shallow water. The frogs, flies, and black birds shatter any guise of peace. \n\nThe wood beneath you is slippery. Whenever the woman makes a sudden movement, you flinch, preparing your shell to push her away. \n\n“Don’t have any doubts,” she speaks calmly, looking in the distance. “I have little trust to offer you, and even less patience. It’s better that we meet this way, instead of on the road,” she turns toward you, and moves her hand behind her back. “But if you have no good reason to talk to me, you can scat right away.

    old "[custom1]Without another word, she leads you back, then through the gate. The old, rotting roof of the only building is starting to bend under its own weight, but its condition is only slightly worse than that of the area around it. The broken tools, soggy planks and logs, the broken fence of an animal pen, and the waist-high nettle leaves growing on every scrap of ground that’s not been beaten down by boots - the hamlet smells of putridity. \n\nThe screeching of animals isn’t as overwhelming here, but unlike in the other settlements, there’s hardly any labor to fill the emptiness. The bandits either follow you, or sit around idly. There’s firewood gathered by the wall, and you see someone eating a piece of cold, roasted meat, but it seems like no one is eager to grab a hammer, a needle, or a carving knife. \n\n{color=#f6d6bd}Glaucia{/color} doesn’t stop, making you follow her around the long shelter. She keeps her eyes straight ahead, not commenting on anything you walk by. With every step, her mail jangles slightly, breaking the silence. Your eyes either wander around, or stare at the back of her head. "
