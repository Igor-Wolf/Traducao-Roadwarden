The entrance, and the wall in general, were recently constructed, though are still not finished - there will soon be yet another gate, allowing for trade and conversations without opening the village to danger. \n\nJust like in the fields, the work is divided between the undead, who carry bricks and take care of the most thankless tasks, while the locals cut rocks and spread mortar. The difficult past is still carved in the villagers’ gaunt faces and crude outfits, and their brief glances show little curiosity. A few of them are sharing a meal right next to the well, and the victuals in their baskets consist of green leaves, fruits, eggs, and cuts of roasted meat. The food of foragers. \n\nYou’re told to wait here for {color=#f6d6bd}the mayor{/color}. “Don’t roam on your own,” the guard’s voice is harsh, despite the stutter. "
