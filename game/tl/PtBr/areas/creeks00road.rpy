    old "The road east is beaten and clean, with enough space to fit two wagons side-by-side. You pass by a few plum trees, apple trees, and cherry trees, but many more stumps, likely belonging to what has been turned into {color=#f6d6bd}Foggy Lake{/color}. \n\nThe life in the plains is busy and loud, but so far you don’t see any lurking beasts. Judging by the many trampled parts of the meadows and the fresh food trails, the foragers search this corner of the peninsula quite often. "

    old "You reach a shining pond at the edge of the forest. You ride beneath two trimmed trees growing on the opposite sides of the path, like columns leading to Wright’s temple. Shouts and heavy steps prepare you for trouble ahead. \n\nTwo shells are circling around each other. One of them is a four-legged saurian, with dark-gray skin, as long as your palfrey but only knee-high. It’s wandering left and right along the bank, hissing, repetitively sticking its split tongue out and then retracting it. The stout monster doesn’t look like a born hunter of humans, but its long tail is swinging like a whip, for now only threateningly so, but you don’t doubt that getting hit by it would likely break your bones. \n\nThe second one belongs to a brown-skinned man wearing leather pants, a long, brown woolen cloak, and the matching pelt of a wolf on his head and shoulders, like a haunting hood. His voice is both gentle and scared, and he’s stretching his hands in front of him, trying to make the beast stay away as if it’s a mouflon. \n\nA third shell is right in the middle between the other two, a creature you don’t recognize from a distance, but it is in a puddle of its own blood and isn’t moving.
