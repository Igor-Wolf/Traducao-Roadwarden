    old "The unbodied keeper of the garden is standing still, with a dark cloak on their shoulders and an eyeless face observing the woodlands. Their club, more than three times as tall as you are, is made of a single piece of rock, and could squash you by simply collapsing, without anyone’s will. \n\nA set of stairs leads into a convenient, corridor-like ravine. The gentle wind carries no shouts or scent of blood. "
