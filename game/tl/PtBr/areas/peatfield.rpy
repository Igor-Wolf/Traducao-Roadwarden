    old "You ride along shallow waters on one side, and flooded trees on the other. You reach what seems like the end of the road - the turn south is already overgrown, most likely abandoned after it was devoured by the bog. \n\nBut as you look north, you see a wide clearing that, with time, has become a meadow, and a lonely hut at the end of an often-traveled path. At first, you ride down slightly, following the twisted trail. [custom1]There’s plenty of puddles around, as well as brown, gray, and purple grasses, but all of them are too short for any lurking predators, and the few foxes you see far away don’t pay you any attention. \n\nYou pass by the fresh tracks of heavy, hooved beasts, but spot no wild game in sight. Your ears can’t free themselves from the birds, rodents, [custom2] "

    old "The farther north you ride, the shorter the grass gets. These vast peat fields, broader than two or three villages placed side by side, are many years old. The turf bricks surrounding the solitary hut are still fresh, drying in the late summer light. \n\nThe scent of this area is like that of no bog you’ve ever encountered - instead of a sublime aroma of healthy soil, it’s intense, sulfury, leaving an almost sour taste on your tongue. The short scarp is dripping with water, like a running sore of the earth, carved with spade and muscle. \n\nThe house, made of birch wood, dried turf, and a blanket of soil, is a structure you’re not too familiar with, but you imagine its interiors are much smaller than they appear to be. The walls are a few feet thick to keep in the warmth, and such roofs tend to get soggy, until they collapse after a decade or so. \n\nThe only soul in sight is sitting on the bench, stuffing his mouth with fistfuls of green leaves that he takes out of a small basket placed on his knees.

    old "Still chewing, he mutters something in response, then shakes his hairy head, swallows, and puts the basket away. He stands up and takes a single step forward, approaching the edge of the scarp. \n\nHis arms are entangled by green creepers, longer than he is tall. They rub against the ground after each step, and judging by the way they occasionally twitch, they’re very much alive, even though you can’t see where they originate from. \n\n“[pcname], the {i}roadwarden{/i},” he repeats, this time clearly. He moves his sealed lips left and right, as if he’s tasting your name, still not sure if he should swallow it, or spit it out. “[custom2]Your face’s familiar, ba not {i}this{/i},” he points at your mount, staring at it for a good minute. \n\nHis voice is quiet and young, not older than thirty. If you were standing next to each other, he would be almost a head shorter than you, but for now, he towers over you. He has sunken cheeks and sloped shoulders, and while his gray, woolen robe was never pretty, it’s now close to being a rag, and his sandals reveal long toenails. "

The leather strips on his wrists and ankles hold beads, pieces of amber, old game dice, and tiny skulls of birds and critters. \n\nEven more cords are hanging from his neck, some of them so long they reach his stomach. They carry countless amulets, some of them torn, dried, shabby, or fragmented, and you spot among them small boxes made of wood and bone, as well as leather pouches, which hide even more secrets. \n\n“Were you here before?
