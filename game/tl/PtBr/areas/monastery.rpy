Telling from their conversation, some of those plants are going to end up as pickles. \n\nYou turn around, once again noticing the constant roar of the river, in the valley deep down.

Even {color=#f6d6bd}Decime{/color}, like always both vigilant and absent, is focused on the picture of an eagle that she’s been drawing with her small boot. "
