Their clean-shaven faces reveal that they’re in their early twenties. {color=#f6d6bd}The first one{/color} is taller than you, broad-shouldered, and wears light brown pants and a darker jacket, both of them made of leather.

He’s unusually short and wears a heavy cloak made of black fur, so large it could cover his entire shell.

The building resembles a merchant’s house from {color=#f6d6bd}Hovlavan{/color}, whitewashed and with oiled, elegant wooden beams. The fragile walls are high enough to avoid floods and snow, but you have no doubt that a troll, or even a pebbler, could easily break through them. The palisade is short, has hardly any support, and has no walkway for crossbowmen. Hardly enough for even a makeshift hamlet. \n\nYet it’s the open harbor that makes you uneasy. Aside from the fish, any creature, aquatic or not, could just walk into the yard, undisturbed. The path is covered with paw prints and claw marks. "
