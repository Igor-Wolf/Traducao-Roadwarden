    old "[stonebridge_dayfluff] The simple bridge is centuries old, bitten by time.[stonebridge_likedolmen] \n\nThe torrent here is deep and fast, with plenty of fish. The boat is destroyed beyond repair - rotten, falling to pieces, with holes in the floor and on the sides, overgrown with fungi and moss. \n\nThe thick shrubs lining the path are covered with thorns. Small birds are jumping from one twig to another, pecking at the brown berries. [stonebridge_berries_fluff] "
