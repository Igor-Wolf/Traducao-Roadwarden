They have been used for many years, with only the wooden parts being somewhat in shape since they seem to have been recently replaced. The steel chisels and saws are jagged and dull, the hammers and axes are made of stone. “Some of them were brought here by the settlers, and we can’t buy any more right now. There’s work to be done, but I do have a plan.” \n\nYou ask him to explain, and he’s all too eager to do so. He enters the nearby house and shows you his more successful works, each of which has some shortcomings, noticeable even to a layperson. A bowl engraved with fish was poorly planned, with animals too large to fit into the entire space, and so a part of it is blank; a simple relief of two naked people in their embrace looks almost believable, but the legs are in one case too long, and in the other - too short; one chair has a broken leg, and the remaining three show that they are a bit too ambitiously shaped, and got dangerously thin; the chest seems fine, but equipment sticks out of it, and the man acknowledges that he wrongly estimated the required size.
