    old "You get a good look at the village from a distant hill. It’s torn between taming the crags and succumbing to their whims. The gray boulders are like the rotting teeth of a giant, sprinkled around by an ancient spirit. The carved cave mouths are covered with wooden doors. There are only a few windows, and you can only imagine how dark and cold the gouged out rooms have to be. \n\nThe buildings and walls, made of logs or stone blocks, must be much younger than the caves. The impressive, whitewashed keep, standing on the top of the hill in the west, could just as well have been built in the city. Smoke rises from both sides of the wild river. \n\nYou see many busy souls as they go about moving tools, food, and timber over the bridge. Your arrival at the eastern gate causes some curious glances, but the only person who approaches you is a man who was sitting at a table, discussing something with a few elders. He’s carrying a crossbow on his back and a long rusty knife at his side, but doesn’t reach for them. "

All them beasts do nothing but fly and seek weaklings to catch. We tried to tame them with fish, but they never learn, dumber than a bat they are.” \n\nOnce their tale ends, an older worker clears his throat. “Ehm... I don’t feel well with the walking shells from the tunnel, in the south,” he doesn’t look at you, as if he’s speaking against his will. “I know not where they came from, but I once shot at them with a bow. It just... The arrow, right? {color=#f6d6bd}Florus{/color}, the fletcher, makes good ones... Flew through the bones. No flesh to stop it. I ran for help, but the awoken was gone before we came back.” \n\nHis friend pats his shoulder. “Next time aim for the head, that’s all.” "

Now, finding them on our own takes so much time it’s hardly worth the effort.” \n\nMost of the time, the crew seeks weak and dying trees, using them to fuel the fires of smokers and salters. "

And where I lost half of my foot,” he laughs briefly and hits his left boot with a hoe, but since it’s closed, it doesn’t reveal any wounds. “We spent a few springs and summers there, we did, many years ago, but once the cats moved in during winter, we had to quit. It was a cute spot, with carpets of flowers, and so many frogs...” \n\nWhen you ask him for some directions, he smiles at the clouds. “We used to go from here to the crossroads, where {color=#f6d6bd}Foggy{/color} now has her tavern, then farther south, to the watchtower, and then west, through the shortcut. That’s where you’ll find the cairn, in the heart of the woods, and a path north from there, to the camp.” "

    old "While fish are being smoked at any fireplace you find, the dedicated smokehouse is at the edge of the village, close to the saltery, but far enough to save the locals from some of its smell. You exchange a few words with the workers, learning that salting takes place mainly during night time, after the fresh fish arrive, and the smoking occurs all day long, “above torched shavings,” without much supervision. “Smoked fish stay fresh for longer than you think, unless you take them outside. Then the rotting starts after merely a few days, so we only sell them to the closer villages. Salted fish last for seasons, but you have to rinse them rightly in a stream, or they’ll burn your mouth with all them salt.” \n\nAs you observe the workers, most of whom seem either old, tiny, or hindered by past wounds, you notice how stiff their fingers seem to be, covered with cuts, making you wonder how much salt gets into even the slightest of scratches. Yet they talk with ease, spending most of their hours gathered in the square, chatting face to face without care, saying not a word about the smell and sight of the scaled, gutted, and boned creatures that surround them. \n\nYou ask about the prices of their barrels of fish and the way they are transported, learning that flour and other supplies are worth more to the locals than dragon bones. After a few minutes, you exchange goodbyes, trying to memorize the details useful for the city guild. While there are always fresh fish available in {color=#f6d6bd}Hovlavan{/color}, having a secure supply of preserved meat would be worth many coins during stormy or frozen days. "
