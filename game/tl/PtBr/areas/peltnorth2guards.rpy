    old "{color=#f6d6bd}The woman in yellow armor{/color} is kneeling next to a brown, hairy boar, which is resting on its side. The beast is not as large as the dark ones from the forests. It responds to the touch of the human’s hand and brush with grateful grunting and rapid twitches of a hind hoof. No matter how friendly it appears, it’s still tethered to the well, and you have no doubts that its charge would leave {color=#f6d6bd}[horsename]{/color} dead in a breath. \n\nWhen the woman notices you, she steps forward, to the boar’s disappointment. “So, the new roadwarden?” She points at a window with her chin, forestalling the question. “We don’t need anything now, but when we travel with our furs, we can use some assistance.” \n\nShe may be around thirty, but her warm voice and bright smile are camouflaging the touch of time on her unpowdered face. Like many red-haired people with freckles, her skin is unhealthily pale. \n\nThe boar runs up to her, observing your boots and fruitlessly sniffing for food beneath the beaten ground. She pats its back, but maintains her focus. “How about a game or two? We have a bit of time and can talk a bit about this and that, maybe you’ll get a couple of coins. Or lose one.” She winks. “We could play dice, or throw axes at a target.” "

Also some blue wolves, they spend their time spread around, but howl to one another when they find good prey. Trust me, don’t ever try to fight a pack. Their furs are valuable, even the gray ones, but the only way to hurt them is setting up a trap. They abandon those that can’t be helped... But not the spotted wolves. They always try to help their wounded.” \n\nAfter a brief moment, she carries on. “But the furless wolves... Those are the worst. They live alone, but are as dangerous as an entire group. Once you find one, you can’t run away from it, you can’t scare it off if it’s not bleeding. You must stay brave, especially when it charges at you. It’s going to jump, oh, this high” she raises her hand to her neck. “Duck beneath it, as quickly as you can.” "

    old "“Oh, I’ve never been there. What’s the place like?” You describe what you’ve seen of the tunnel and its inhabitants. In the meantime, she throws the boar a snack, observing how it brutally murders an apple. “That’s not easy, they aren’t like, stupid. You want something not {i}too{/i} obvious. Maybe deadfalls above entrances, ones made of wood and rocks. And pointy whip traps in spots that would mask the trigger cords... Are there any corridors, sharp turns?” \n\nYou speak with her for the next few minutes, then she leads you up a ladder, to the wall walk. She points at a few branches, telling you about the {i}whips{/i} then draws on the wall with a piece of charcoal, explaining how to build some simple traps. “Some really good ones can hold creatures in place, but unless you have a crossbow or something like it, it won’t help much. You dig a hole in some soft ground, then surround it with sticks, maybe camouflage it. A {i}foothold trap{/i}, you see.” \n\nShe offers to show you how to make one, then repeats her previous instructions. You nod with gratitude. "

There are two people I’ve heard of who would like to join us. {color=#f6d6bd}Erastos{/color} from {color=#f6d6bd}Howler’s Dell{/color} and {color=#f6d6bd}Cassia{/color} from {color=#f6d6bd}Gale Rocks{/color}.” \n\nShe rubs the side of her boar, then pushes it away gently, as if she’s asking a child to play by itself for a few minutes. “The thing is we already have hunters who used to live in these places, and they told me they ain’t all too eager to welcome them here. I’d like you to speak with them both, and to ask the folks from their tribes about them. Before I make a decision whom should I invite, I need to be sure they can handle the job.” "
