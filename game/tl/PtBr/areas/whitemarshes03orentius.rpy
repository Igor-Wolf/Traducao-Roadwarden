    old "You observe the preparations. Twelve village guards, assisted by many more, inspect the straps and cords of their gambesons and the sharpness of their blades. A few of them were planning to take rations of food and water, but are now being told to leave them behind. “Whoever’s ne returning tonight,” grunts a man with a short reflex bow as he tests the strings, “is ne coming back at all.” \n\nThere’s quite a commotion, despite the cooling dusk air. Families and friends don’t spare best wishes and words of wisdom. Two brothers are crying as they embrace, while a spearwoman in her thirties promises her sons she’ll be with them when they wake up. \n\nFinally, the last group of fighters arrives at the village, and you head to the gate, ready to discuss the plan with your allies in the weak light of the lanterns. {color=#f6d6bd}Thais{/color} shows off her dress, powders, and rouges, with her deer-shaped buckle glimmering at the edge of darkness. When she speaks, others listen, when she makes a joke, they politely join her chuckle. People half her age look away in embarrassment when she catches them glancing at her elegantly spread hair, red lips, and revealed neck. "

    old "Every minute spent in the darkness feels like ten. Your eyes track frightened birds, cracking twigs, moving leaves. Your limbs are heavy, and your senses are begging for a break. \n\nBecause of your stench and the losses you already suffered, the beasts are now looking for an easy catch. Your shouts and torches help, but after a short clash you leave one more shell to a pack of wolf-like creatures. {i}What difference will yet another undead make anyway{/i}, you think, unable to feel any more dread. \n\nYour companions don’t talk to each other, but you’ve heard the word “murderer” at least twice.

You don’t pay much attention to the tears and embraces shared among the locals - like most people in your group, you just want to sleep. \n\nBut {color=#f6d6bd}the mayor{/color} won’t allow it just yet. As her neighbors walk away, making space for her, you notice an unusual pattern of lines left on her face, as well as the distorted rouge on her lips. There are white specks of powder on her sleeve - she must have taken a nap. \n\nEven though one of her guards tries to speak up, she asks {i}you{/i} to report to her. Not paying much attention to your words, you recap the more significant parts of the evening, making everyone who can hear you fall silent. “{color=#f6d6bd}White Marshes{/color} has fallen,” people whisper, and these words spread like a wave, stinging your soul every time you hear the village’s name. {color=#f6d6bd}Thais{/color} orders them to let you speak, but you don’t have much to add. \n\n[custom4] She then reaches for the deer on her buckle, and gives you a long, angry look. “Was there really no other option?” "
