Still barefoot and with a worn robe, she looks like a cook in an herbal garden. \n\nYou approach the pond and she takes a deep breath. The geese in the distance are as gray as her irises. “We’re just in time, the air is still fresh,” her tone is hard to decipher, and she keeps taking long pauses. “I’ve built so much, and over so many years.
